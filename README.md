# ToDo-List

Project Outline:

This is a project I undertook as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The primary objective of this project was to create a To-Do web application using Webpack as a bundler. The ToDo app lets users add Tasks to Projects and then view Tasks by certain time frames. Tasks can be edited and deleted as well as being checked off. Project folders can also be added and removed

Challenges:

This was quite a challenging project for me to finish at a standard I was happy with and in the end I got a great desktop version and mobile-sized dev-tools-working version too (though it fails to load properly on mobile, not layout-wise though.. code not behaving right, which is a bit beyond me at this stage to know how to fix. And, I'm a bit disappointed I couldn't get it working right on mobile).

The project started off fairly well and separated into modules/different functions but it ballooned out pretty quickly and I became a bit overwhelmed with where to put particular sections of code and how to communicate back and forth between modules. But, on the plus side I learnt a lot about the behaviour of modules, how to handle dates, using localStorage to store and retrieve data, interacting with JSON objects using JSON.parse and JSON.stringify and some serious DOM manipulation. I feel like I overcomplicate the coding and could do with more planning ahead of time instead of working it out on the fly.
